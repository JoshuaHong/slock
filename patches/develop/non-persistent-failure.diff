# Description
# The failure flag was not being reset after a failure occures.
# This causes a problem with the failonclear flag in the config file.
# When the password buffer is empty the failure color should not be displayed
# if the failonclear flag is set to 0. However, this was only true if an
# incorrect password was not previously entered. After an incorrect
# password is entered, the failure color was displayed when the buffer is
# cleared even with the failonclear flag set to 1.
# The solution was to reset the failure flag after every keypress.
